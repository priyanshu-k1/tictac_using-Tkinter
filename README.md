This repository contains a Python Tkinter program for a Tic Tac Toe game. The game is played by two players, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

The program uses the following Python modules:

* Tkinter: This module is used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the game.
* random: This module is used to randomly select the first player and other works.
* pygame for playing music in the backgound

The program is written in a modular fashion, with each major component of the game implemented in its own function. This makes the code easy to read and understand, and it also makes it easy to modify the game.

To play the game, clone the repository and run the `TicTac.py` file. The game will start in a window with a 3x3 grid. Click on a tile it will mark the tile with a "X" or "O" as per assigned by the game . The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

I hope you enjoy playing this Tic Tac Toe game!
